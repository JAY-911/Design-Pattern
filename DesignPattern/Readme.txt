In this assignment, you will practice implementing some of the design patterns discussed in class.

In your assignment, you must follow the same naming and design conventions discussed in the lecture, including the naming test classes and test methods.

Part I: Basic Design Patterns Implementation (70%)

Implement the following design patterns and use Junit to demonstrate how they function. 

Singleton pattern (test cases should ensure that only a single object can be created)
Fa√ßade Pattern
Factory Pattern
For Java Doc:

Provide author and version information for each class.
Provide documentation for each method, clearly describing the purpose of the method. Describe parameters it receives, and the values it returns.
Describe attributes and provide rationale for their use.
For Junit:

A complete implementation will include at least three test cases per design pattern (A single test case is sufficient for Singleton pattern).
Part II: State Design Pattern (30%)

Use the code you submitted for the Moon Rover and redesign it using the State Pattern.

Use Junit to demonstrate the correctness of your solution.

Sample Moon Rover Implementation available: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ev1k4j9xyirvid4/Moon%20Rover%20Assignment%20Code.zip?dl=0Links to an external site.

What to submit

1.Your code, including all test code and sample runs.
2.Screen capture of Junit runs (showing passing and failing test cases, if any).
3.Submit by the due date, late assignments are not accepted.
